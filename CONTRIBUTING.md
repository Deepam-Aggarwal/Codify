# Welcome
Thankyou for deciding to contribute to this project and taking your time to read this.<br />

# Why you should take this seriously?
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.<br />

# Contribution we are looking from?
<b>Codify</b>is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!<br />There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Codify itself.<br />

# Contribution we are NOT looking for?
Please don't use issue tracker and report for support questions and try not to waste time of other developers. If you find an issue first of all make sure that it is an issue and find answers to it by referring to stackoverflow and other such sites to make sure it is a issue. And if your problem is not strictly of our code and its deployment please refrain from contacting us and if you still wish to had a talk then use discussions.<br />

# Ground Rules
### Behavioral Responsibility 
While reporting an issue, requesting for a new feature, providing ideas please be respectful to other developers who created <b>Codify</b> and value their time, dedication in making the site more useful for you, acknowledging your contributions. We (our team) will also respect you and your contributions, will work hard to provide you all the things you want.
### Technical Responsibility 
<ul>
<li>Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.</li>
<li>The new change should be responsive and work in all browsers</li>
<li>Ensure you use best practices while developing the code</li>
<li>Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.</li>
<li>Don't create new stylesheet or try to declare things repeatedly and before styling an element please do check that there is no previous styling for that element and if does then it shouldn't contradict.</li>
<li>Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version</li>
</ul>
Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.<br />

# Getting started
<b>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:</b>
<ol>
<li>Create your own fork of the code</li>
<li>Do the changes in your fork</li>
<li>If you like the change and think the project could use it. * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project with <b>LICENSE</b>*</li>
</ol>

<b>Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a LICENSE</b>

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
<ol>
<li>Spelling / grammar fixes</li>
<li>Typo correction, white space and formatting changes</li>
<li>Comment clean up</li>
<li>Bug fixes that change or re align</li>
<li>Changes to 'cache time'</li>
<li>Moving source files from one directory or package to another</li>
</ol>

# How to report an issue?
Any security issues should be submitted directly to our email (ask) or should reach us separately through our blogs or other medium. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?<br />
Can I disable something for other people?<br />
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just reach us out.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

Which page of the site?
Which browser are you using?
Which device are you using?
What did you expect to see?
What did you see instead? 

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in <b>Codify</b>, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that <b>Codify</b> has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in private. Feedback is given to all the pull requests.After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
